# Time-Series-Project
1. Pick a data set that has two or more variables recorded over time (similar to the Schumway LA air quality data from Unit 12. (dataset: lap from package: astsa) (can’t use this one  )
2. Select a response from the data set.
3.  Be creative and come up with a scenario as to why a client would want to analyze this data and why this response is important!  Or better yet, use a real problem that you are interested in!
4. Fit at least one model from each of the following four categories (provide all plots and tables needed to ID these models: acfs, spectral density, factor tables, etc.):
	a. ARMA / ARIMA / ARUMA / Signal Plus Noise (univariate analysis)
	b. VAR with at least one explanatory model.
	c.  Neural Network
	d. Ensemble model using at least two of the above.  (this model does not have to “beat” your 
     other models.
5. Compare all models with the ASE… this does not mean you have to choose the model with the lowest ASE. 
6. Pick a forecast horizon based on your “problem” from part 3 above and provide the forecasts and prediction limits.  
7. Create a ppt and a 7-minute video describing your analysis and steps 1 – 6 above.   
8. Post that video to you-Tube and the (private) link to the Google-Doc and submit your ppt and Rmd File (or Jupyter notebook) to 2DS.  Please leave the link on the Google Doc for a week so others can learn from your presentation.  Please check out at least 3 of your peer’s presentations and please watch your own presentation as well.   It is often very useful (although always a bit awkward for me at least ;) to watch yourself present!
