# Time-Series-Project
### In this project, we analyze 3,202 stock price and volume data time series traded on the NASDAQ exchange between May 30th and October 30th, 2019. This date range was selected for its distance from significant biological and political disruption to the markets, which can both introduce artificial seasonality and increased random variation into forecasts. Data was sourced as comma-separated values through API from AlphaVantage.
1. Pick a data set that has two or more variables recorded over time.
2. Select a response from the data set.
3.  Be creative and come up with a scenario as to why a client would want to analyze this data and why this response is important.
4. Fit at least one model from each of the following four categories (provide all plots and tables needed to ID these models):
	a. ARMA / ARIMA / ARUMA / Signal Plus Noise (univariate analysis)
	b. VAR with at least one explanatory model.
	c. Neural Network
	d. Ensemble model using at least two of the above.
5. Compare all models with the ASE.
6. Pick a forecast horizon based on your “problem” from part 3 above and provide the forecasts and prediction limits.
7. Create a PowerPoint and a 7-minute video describing your analysis and steps 1 – 6 above.
8. Post that video to you-Tube and the (private) link to the Google-Doc and submit your ppt and Rmd File (or Jupyter notebook) to 2DS.
