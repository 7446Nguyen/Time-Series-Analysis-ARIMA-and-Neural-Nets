# Time-Series-Project
### In this project, we analyze 3,202 stock price and volume data time series traded on the NASDAQ exchange between May 30th and October 30th, 2019. This date range was selected for its distance from significant biological and political disruption to the markets in order to build a proof of concept model for selecting and forecasting. Data was sourced as comma-separated values through API from AlphaVantage.

### Models applied and evaluted include Signal-Plus-Noise, ARIMA, Vector Autoregressive (VAR), Neural Networks using Multi-Layered Perceptrons, and composite ensemble models. Models are compared using the Average Squared Error (ASE).
